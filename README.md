Game Overview

This game is designed to enhance processing speed, a key cognitive skill referring to how quickly one can perceive information (visual, auditory, or motor) and respond automatically. The gameplay focuses on spatial orientation—awareness of one’s surroundings and ability to adapt to changes.

The game is an extension of the classic maze format. A penguin, controlled with the arrow keys, must reach a target point. However, the twist is that the game board rotates multiple times by 90° during play, altering the function of the arrow keys. Players must quickly deduce the new control mappings and guide the penguin efficiently.

To increase the challenge, a rival black penguin starts from the same point and races toward the goal. If it arrives first, the player loses. Success depends on the player’s ability to rapidly process environmental changes and react accordingly.
